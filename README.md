# RegistrationWebapp
This spring application registers, edits or deletes users from a database. 
I used AngularJS for the frontend, java and mySQL for the backend.
<br />
The first step was to create a mySQL database. We did not create any tables 
on the server all the tables will be created automatically,but we will need
the server url, and we created a username and a password for the server.
You should create the mySQL server and write this information in the resource
folder,at the application.properties file.
